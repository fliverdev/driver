Fliver is a smartphone app for iOS and Android to help ease the process of getting a taxi when you need one. We obtain information about user demand for taxis, based on which density hotspots are created to inform the taxi drivers where there are people looking for a taxi.

This is the Driver app repository for Drivers to view the areas of Rider demand. It is part of the Final Year Project of a bunch of Computer Engineering students.

## Building
