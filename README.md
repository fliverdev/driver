Fliver is a smartphone app for iOS and Android to help ease the process of getting a taxi when you need one. We obtain information about user demand for taxis, based on which we create density hotspots to inform the taxi drivers where there are people looking for a taxi.

This is the driver app repository for drivers to view the locations of rider demand. It is part of the Final Year Project of a bunch of Computer Engineering students.

## Building

To build and run the app on your device, do the following:

-   Install Flutter by following the instructions on their [website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/).
-   Fork/clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/fliverdev/driver.git`.
-   **Important:** the `AppDelegate.swift` and `AndroidManifest.xml` files are currently encrypted due to the use of API keys, so the project will not build directly for either platforms. To resolve this issue, please overwrite the existing `AppDelegate.swift` and `AndroidManifest.xml` files with your own.
-   Connect your devices/emulators and run the app using `flutter run --release` in the root of the project directory.

**Note:** you can also run it faster in debug mode using `flutter run`, but the animations will be choppy and performance won't be as expected.
