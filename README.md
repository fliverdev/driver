Fliver is a smartphone app to cater to the gross mismanagement of autorickshaw services in India. When you need an autorickshaw, you can simply open the app and mark your location. When there are 3 or more Riders in the same area, Drivers get notified and can view the areas of high demand, and accordingly come to pick Riders up.

The entire project is open source and free of charge. There are no additional costs for Riders besides for the regular metered rickshaw fare, and there is no commission that Drivers need to pay. Fliver is a completely non-profit project, created to benefit Indian citizens.

This is the Driver app repository for Drivers to view areas of high demand. It is part of the Final Year Project of three Computer Engineering students.
